# Project Title:GPT LawAid
(Alternative for healthcare:MediQuery AI)

# Project Description

GPT LawAid is an intelligent AI-powered assistant designed to answer complex legal (or medical) queries by combining the reasoning power of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4o with document-specific factual accuracy via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

Unlike standard chatbots, GPT LawAid allows users to upload domain-specific documents such as legal codes, court rulings, or healthcare policies, and receive natural language answers grounded in those documents. The system retrieves the most relevant information from the userâ€™s document base and uses GPT to generate context-aware, human-readable responses.
